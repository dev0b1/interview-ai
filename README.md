# interview-ai

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript starter with Tailwind CSS.

What's included

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (wired via PostCSS)
- ESLint (Next.js recommended config)

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

Notes

- Tailwind config is at `tailwind.config.cjs` and looks at `src/app` and `src/components`.
- PostCSS is configured in `postcss.config.mjs` and requires `autoprefixer` and `tailwindcss` to be installed.
- If you see editor errors about unknown at-rules for `@tailwind`, make sure your editor or CSS plugin supports PostCSS/Tailwind or ensure `postcss.config.mjs` is picked up by your tooling.

Next steps

- Tell me what your app will do and I can scaffold pages, components, and types.
